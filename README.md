## Measurement of phase and frequency using lissajous pattern.

## Aim :

Checking the frequencies of the Sine, Square, and Triangle waves on the waveform generator This experiment will help the students to learn measuring voltages, time, frequency. This experiment will help the students to learn about lissajous figures

## Procedure:

Connect the components as mentioned below: L1-L5, L3-L6, L4-L7, L2-L7.(For eg. click on 1 and then drag to 5 and so on.) Click on 'Check Connection' button to check the connections. If connected wrong, click on the wrong connection. Else click on 'Delete all connection' button to erase all the connections. Connect L1-L5. This will connect the function generator 1 to channel 1 probe of oscilloscope. Connect L3-L6. This will connect the function generator 2 to channel 2 probe of oscilloscope. Connect L4-L7, L2-L7. This will connect the ground of function generator 1 and function generator 2 with oscilloscope. Click on 'ON' button to start the experiment. Double Click on 'Sine Wave' button to generate input waveform (2 Vp-p, 1kHz) from Function Generator 1. Double Click on 'Sine Wave' button to generate input waveform (2 Vp-p, 1kHz) from Function Generator 2. Vary the Amplitude, Frequency, volt/div using the controllers. Double Click on "Dual" button to observe both the waveform. Click on "X-Y" button to observe the specialized two-channel mode of oscilloscope. The XY time mode converts the oscilloscope from a volts-versus-time display to a volts-versus-volts display using two input channels. Channel 1 is the X-axis input, channel 2 is the Y-axis input. Channel 1 shows the waveform of Function Generator 1, Channel 2 shows the waveform of Function Generator 2. Repeat step 10-12 for 'Square Wave' and 'Triangular Wave'. Double Click on input button to generate input waveform (2 Vp-p, 1kHz) from Function Generator 1 and Function Generator 2. Note : Sometimes due to page load or cache, the graph may not come exact at one click. So it is better to double click on the channel-1 function/ channel-2 function/ dual function/ground function to get the respective signals. Oscilloscope and function generator is described more elaborately in the Oscilloscope Tutorial section.

## Formula:

## CALCULATION :

Vm = ( No. of Minor division) x (per scale division) x Multiplying factor, or Vm = ( No. of Major division) x Multiplying factor

Tm = ( No. of Minor division) x (per scale division) x Multiplying factor, or Tm = ( No. of Major division) x Multiplying factor

where, Multiplying factor is the volt/div or time/div, If volt/div= 1 volt; 1 Major div is 1v and each minor div is 0.2v. If time/div= 0.1 ms; 1 Major div is 0.1ms and each minor div is 0.02 ms.
